# suju-devil-interactive-video
This is an interactive music video created as an experiment of keyboard interaction. The idea was inspired by Spencer Sheridan from Google Chrome Experiments. Some of the motion graphics are self-created or from giphy. The purpose of making this project is to learn and play with javascript and appreciate the amazing performance by Super Junior.
